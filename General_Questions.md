### <span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>🔹 1. What is EDI and Why Use It Instead of Modern Formats Like JSON?</strong></span>

---

### <span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>📘 Definition</strong></span>

- **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**: A rigid, standardized format used for business-to-business (B2B) transactions like purchase orders, invoices, and shipping notices.  
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A flexible, lightweight format used in modern applications and APIs—ideal for customer-facing systems and real-time communication.

---

### <span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>🏢 Use Cases</strong></span>

| **Scenario** | **Format Used** | **Why** |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| Customer buying 1 item on Amazon | JSON | Fast, readable, real-time, works with mobile/web apps |
| Amazon ordering 10,000 laptops from Lenovo | EDI | Standardized, automated, compliant, legacy system compatible |

---

### <span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>🔍 Why EDI Is Still Used</strong></span>

Despite JSON’s flexibility, EDI remains dominant in industries like retail, logistics, healthcare, and finance because:

- It’s **globally standardized** (e.g., ANSI X12, EDIFACT)  
- It supports **automation without manual mapping**  
- It includes **audit trails, control numbers, and acknowledgments**  
- It’s **required by many trading partners** for compliance

---

### <span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>🔧 JSON Can Handle Large Orders Too—So Why Not Replace EDI?</strong></span>

You’re right: JSON can technically handle any size order. But EDI is preferred for bulk transactions because:

- JSON lacks built-in **validation, control, and compliance features**  
- JSON structures vary by company—EDI is **uniform**  
- EDI integrates directly with **ERP systems** like SAP and Oracle  
- EDI supports **batch processing** and **secure transmission protocols** (AS2, VAN)

---

### <span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>🔁 Hybrid Systems: EDI + JSON</strong></span>

Modern companies often use both:

- **EDI** for backend supply chain operations  
- **JSON** for frontend apps and APIs  

**Platforms like webMethods EDI help bridge the gap by:**

- Parsing EDI files  
- Validating business rules  
- Mapping EDI data to internal formats (e.g., JSON, XML)  
- Automating integration with ERP systems

---

### <span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>🧩 webMethods EDI Explained</strong></span>

- It doesn’t just check EDI syntax—it validates **business logic** (e.g., valid SKUs, quantities).  
- It performs **mapping** to convert EDI segments into usable formats for internal systems.  
- It enables **monitoring, alerts, and partner management** for large-scale EDI operations.

### <span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>🧠 Final Insight</strong></span>

| **Format** | **Best For** | **Strengths** |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| JSON | Individual orders, APIs | Fast, flexible, readable |
| EDI | Bulk B2B transactions | Standardized, automated, compliant |
| Hybrid (EDI + JSON) | Enterprises modernizing legacy systems | Combines reliability with flexibility |

## 2.⚠️ What Happens If You Don't Call `getLastError` First

### 🔥 Error Context Gets Cleared or Overwritten
- The error from the Try block is stored in a **temporary execution context**.
- When you run another service (other than `map`), it may:
  - Start a new context
  - Reset the pipeline
  - Internally handle or suppress errors

As a result, when you finally call `pub.flow:getLastError`, it returns **null** or an **empty document** — because the original error is gone.

---

## ✅ Best Practice

Always structure your Catch sequence like this:

```plaintext
Catch Sequence (Exit on Done)
├── map (optional: prepare variables)
├── pub.flow:getLastError → store error in a variable
├── map → extract error/message/stackTrace
├── other services (e.g., logging, alerts, once)
```

This ensures you **capture the error first**, then you're free to run other logic without losing it.
