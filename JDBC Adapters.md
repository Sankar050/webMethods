## 🗃️ What is Database Deadlock?

A **deadlock** happens when two or more transactions are **waiting for each other’s locked resources**, and **none can proceed**.

### 🔁 Example:

- **Transaction A** locks **Row 1**, wants **Row 2**.
- **Transaction B** locks **Row 2**, wants **Row 1**.
- Both are stuck waiting → **deadlock**.

### ✅ How to Prevent Deadlocks:

- 🔄 Lock resources in a **consistent order**.
- ⏱️ Keep transactions **short and fast**.
- 🔁 Use **retry logic** in your application to handle deadlock errors.

Exactly ✅ You’ve got it. Let me summarize everything cleanly for you.

# 🔹 JDBC Transaction Types in webMethods – Key Points

## 1. Local Transaction

- Works with only **one connection alias** inside a transaction.
- ❌ Using two different aliases (even if pointing to the same DB) causes errors like:
  - “resource not available”
  - “error closing transaction”

**✅ Best Practice:**
- Use **one connection alias** for all tables in the same DB.
- Wrap operations with:
  - `startTransaction`
  - `commitTransaction` or `rollbackTransaction`
example:
✅ 
---
TRY BLOCK
├── pub.art.transaction:startTransaction
│     └── transactionName = "local_Transaction_POC"
│
├── Sales.JDBC.adapter:insertSalesRecords
│     └── connection = Sales_connection_postgres
│
├── Sales.JDBC.adapter:students
│     └── connection = Sales_connection_postgres
│
└── pub.art.transaction:commitTransaction
      └── transactionName = "local_Transaction_POC"
CATCH BLOCK
├── pub.flow:getLastError
└── pub.art.transaction:rollbackTransaction
      └── transactionName = "local_Transaction_POC"

❌
---
TRY BLOCK
├── pub.art.transaction:startTransaction
│     └── transactionName = "XA_Transaction_POC"
│
├── Sales.JDBC.adapter:insertSalesRecords
│     └── connection = Sales_connection_postgres
│
├── Sales.JDBC.adapter:students
│     └── connection = Sales_connection_students
│
└── pub.art.transaction:commitTransaction
      └── transactionName = "XA_Transaction_POC"
CATCH BLOCK
├── pub.flow:getLastError
└── pub.art.transaction:rollbackTransaction
      └── transactionName = "XA_Transaction_POC"

  
# 🔹 Your Case: Employee + Student Tables

### ✅ If both tables are in the **same database**:
- Use **one connection alias** with **Local Transaction**.
- ❌ Don’t use two aliases — will cause transaction errors.
- If you use two aliases:
  - You’d need **two separate start/commit blocks**
  - This means **two independent transactions** (not recommended due to risk of partial commits)

### ✅ If tables are in **different databases**:
- You must configure **both aliases as XA Transaction**
- This allows handling them in **one atomic transaction**

---

# 🔹 Final Rule of Thumb

| Scenario                     | Recommended Transaction Type |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| One DB                      | Local Transaction            |
| Multiple DBs/resources      | XA Transaction               |
| Read-only operations        | No Transaction               |

---

✅ So yes, your statement is correct:

- **Standard**: Use one connection for the same DB when using Local Transaction.
- **Technically**: You can split into two independent transaction blocks with two aliases, but it’s **not recommended** (no rollback safety).

## 2. XA Transaction

- Needed when you want **multiple aliases or multiple resources** (e.g., DB + JMS, DB1 + DB2(on same db server or different DB servers like oracle, mysql) to participate in **one transaction**.
- Uses **two-phase commit** to ensure **all-or-nothing** behavior.
- Slightly slower than Local, but safer for **cross-resource operations**.
- we have tried to implement a POC we have created 2 DBs in same postgres server we tried to do XA transaction for both of them and created two different connections. but i did not work.
- 
 # 🔹 Why It’s Failing

- PostgreSQL treats each database (`postgres`, `TCS`) as **completely isolated**.
- Even though they run on the same server, PostgreSQL does **not support distributed XA/2PC across multiple databases**.
- The JDBC driver (`PGXADataSource`) **pretends to support XA**, but it can only coordinate **within a single database connection**.
- When webMethods tries to enlist two different DBs in the same global transaction, PostgreSQL cannot prepare/commit both → you get:
  - “current thread not within any transaction”
  - “connection close” errors

# 🔹 What Works in PostgreSQL

| Setup                                      | XA Support |
|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| XA with one database                      | ✅ Works    |
| XA with two schemas inside one database   | ✅ Works    |
| XA with two different databases           | ❌ Not supported |

---

# 🔹 What Other Databases Can Do

| Database       | XA Across Multiple DBs |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Oracle         | ✅ Supported            |
| SQL Server     | ✅ Supported            |
| DB2            | ✅ Supported            |
| PostgreSQL     | ❌ Limited support      |

> Real distributed transactions in PostgreSQL require external tools like **pgbouncer**, **pglogical**, or a middleware.

---

✅ So yes — your setup is failing because **PostgreSQL itself doesn’t support XA across two DBs**.  
**webMethods is working fine** — the limitation is on the **database side**.

---

## 3. No Transaction

- Each operation **commits immediately**, no rollback.
- Use for **read-only queries** or when **transaction safety is not required**.
